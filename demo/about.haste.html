    <h1>About this demo!</h1>

    <p>
        The page uses a sidebar template layout which itself includes the base layout showing
        how you can "compose" templates together in an extending manner.
    </p>

    <p>
        Below you can find three counters. Each of these are the same included file
        but they are provided variables differently to set the starting count value.

        <br><br>

        The first takes it's value from the template-level variable defined at the top
        of the file. <br>
        The second is provided a starting point via an attribute. <br>
        The third is provided a starting point using a variable tag.
        <br><br>

        This shows how attributes will override template-level variables.

    <t:parts.counter/>
    <t:parts.counter start_at="1000"/>
    <t:parts.counter>
        <v:start_at>5000</v:start_at>
    </t:parts.counter>

    <v:sidebar>
        <h4>Sidebar</h4>
        <p>
            This is sidebar content injected in through a variable tag.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though this content is within the main parsed content it
            is not included within the content output but instead parsed into
            a variable.
        </p>

        <p>
            Variable tags can only be used within a custom template tag.
        </p>

        <t:parts.button href="/">Back Home</t:parts.button>
